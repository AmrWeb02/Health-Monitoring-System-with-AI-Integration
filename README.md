# IoT-Platform-with-AI-Integration
An application enablement platform based on REST API


This project provides a comprehensive health monitoring system that leverages the power of embedded systems, web development, and artificial intelligence. It offers users the following capabilities:

Real-time health data: Continuously monitor your blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) using the MAX30102 oximeter sensor (with optional temperature sensor integration).
Immediate feedback: View sensor readings displayed in real-time on an LCD screen for instant insights into your health status.
Data storage and visualization: Securely transmit sensor data via WiFi to a MySQL database. A user-friendly web interface, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allows you to visualize and analyze your health data effortlessly.
AI-powered insights: Integrate with a chosen AI API to unlock advanced analysis of your health information. Gain personalized insights and recommendations tailored to your unique health profile, fostering a deeper understanding of your well-being.


This project empowers users with:

Enhanced health awareness: Real-time access to health data and AI-driven interpretations enable informed decision-making about your well-being.
Improved self-management: Proactively manage your health with the user-friendly interface, allowing you to track trends and identify potential issues early on.
Personalized insights: The AI integration provides valuable feedback tailored to your unique health profile.
